Next year, when parsing, add a class for Advanced Band to avoid
having to put an in clause for the grades.  This will confine all
the logic for what constitutes an Advanced Band to the parse-signups
script.  As it stands, they are all just Band and then you have to walk
back to person from class_member to get grade, then constrain grades just
for Advanced Band.  I guess classes could have a grade, but that's either
denormalizing or not really a property for an individual class.

When a family's tuition changes, a debit must be added to make
their previous debits equal to one of their future ones.  This could
be automated.
1. Calculate new payment series
2. Compare existing payments to new payment series pairwise
3. Total up differences
4. Add debit equal to total of all differences
