Next year, when parsing, add a class for Advanced Band to avoid
having to put an in clause for the grades.  This will confine all
the logic for what constitutes an Advanced Band to the parse-signups
script.  As it stands, they are all just Band and then you have to walk
back to person from class_member to get grade, then constrain grades just
for Advanced Band.  I guess classes could have a grade, but that's either
denormalizing or not really a property for an individual class.

2. Compare existing payments to new payment series pairwise
3. Total up differences
4. Add debit equal to total of all differences
